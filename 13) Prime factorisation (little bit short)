// learning Goal : to study numbers
// learning Objective : to study prime factorization
// C++
// C plus plus
// Code explanation :
// a) we take an input number to find its prime factorization
// b) In for loop, we start from initial number which is a prime number 2
// c) while loop allows us to find all the prime factors divisible by 2
// d) After that;
// e) from for loop, next number 3 (which is prime number)
// f) with while loop, this prime number 3 finds all the prime factors which are divisible by 3
// g) After that,
// h) from for loop, next number is 4 (which is not prime), but it's (number 4) associated prime factors are already taken by prime number 2
// i) from for loop, next number is 5 (which is prime); finds all the prime factors divisible by 5
// j) from for loop, next number is 6 (which is not prime); but it's (number 6) associated prime factors are already taken by prime number 2 and 3
// h) it goes on
